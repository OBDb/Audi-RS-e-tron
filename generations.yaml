    description: "The Audi RS e-tron GT represents the pinnacle of Audi's electric performance lineup as the first fully electric RS model, combining zero-emission operation with the performance expectations established by Audi's revered RS badge. Built on the J1 platform shared with the Porsche Taycan, the RS e-tron GT features a sleek, low-slung four-door coupe silhouette with dramatic proportions, a muscular stance, and distinctive aerodynamic elements including active vents, a rear diffuser, and an adjustable rear spoiler. Powered by a dual-motor electric powertrain delivering 590 horsepower (637 horsepower with overboost) and 612 lb-ft of torque, the RS e-tron GT accelerates from 0-60 mph in just 3.1 seconds and reaches a top speed of 155 mph. The 93.4 kWh (83.7 kWh usable) battery provides an EPA-estimated range of approximately 232 miles, supported by 800-volt architecture enabling DC fast charging at up to 270 kWâ€”allowing a 5-80% charge in just 22.5 minutes under ideal conditions. Performance-focused features include standard adaptive air suspension, all-wheel steering, and electronic rear differential, with optional carbon-ceramic brakes for maximum stopping power. The interior combines RS sport elements with sustainable materials, featuring standard 14-way adjustable sport seats (with optional 18-way adjustable sport seats plus with ventilation and massage functions), a flat-bottomed RS steering wheel, and Audi's latest MMI touch response system with dual screens and virtual cockpit plus. A unique feature is the standard artificially generated e-tron sport sound, which can be adjusted to provide acoustic feedback proportional to driving style. As Audi's flagship electric performance vehicle, the RS e-tron GT demonstrates the brand's vision for high-performance driving in the electric era, offering exhilarating acceleration, precise handling, and sophisticated technology in a package that maintains the exclusivity and emotional appeal expected of an RS model."
