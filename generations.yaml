    description: "The Audi e-tron GT is a battery electric executive car produced by Audi since late 2020. Built on the J1 platform shared with the Porsche Taycan, it is Audi's first fully electric sedan. Production began in December 2020 at the Heilbronn plant in Germany, with sales starting in May 2021. The design extensively recreates the e-tron GT concept car with muscular wheel arches, aggressively styled headlights, and a large hexagonal radiator grille. The car features dual electric motors powered by a 93.4 kWh (84 kWh usable) battery with 800-volt architecture. The base e-tron GT quattro delivers 350 kW sustained power (390 kW boosted) with 0-100 km/h in 4.1 seconds and 245 km/h top speed. The RS e-tron GT variant, introduced in 2021, offers more sporty performance with 440 kW power (475 kW boosted), achieving 0-100 km/h in 3.3 seconds and 250 km/h top speed. Both variants feature dual-motor all-wheel drive, adaptive air suspension, all-wheel steering, and electronic rear differential. The RS e-tron GT Project_513/2 is a special edition limited to 75 units for the US market introduced in 2023."
